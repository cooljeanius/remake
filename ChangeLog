	Pass in input parameters to decode routines. Better modularity that way.

2012-06-26  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Split out -X from --debugger. -X is boolean-only now.

2012-06-26  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	main.c: Handle -x flag as a boolean. getops doesn't support optional args in short-options well. Makefile.am: comment Makefile trace.h: Allow for future --task-comment only flag. Note weird way trace.h enums work

	Track that changes in GNU without which "make update" would fail.

2012-01-12  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Deal with the fact that "make update" which depends on translator sites can be flaky and broken. Also add --enable-maintainer-mode to configure for doc setup.

2011-12-17  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Bump version number

2011-12-17  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	A little more agressive on showing target descriptions -- Show them on --targets as well as --tasks

	implicit.h was missing from distribution

2011-07-31  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Clear out last target description when we hit another target which might not have one. There was a bug where we were giving stale descriptions to targets which have had empty descriptions.

2011-07-20  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	--task descriptions now work properly.

2011-07-20  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Start allowing for descriptions on --tasks via comments which start out #:. Not quite correct yet though. May also expand Added a description field to a comment. Move our externs and changes to main.c from make.h to main.h. This is cleaner code and separates our changes from the base better.

2011-07-17  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	A more correct depth fix. Need to add this to tests!

2011-07-17  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	There seems to be a bug in GNU make in showing target indentation when --trace or --debug=basic is on. This was noticed by reviewer B for LISA'11. I am not 100% certain of this fix since this is a little more aggressive than some smaller incremental changes. Also, I've change indentation to the more conventional two spaces rather than one for each level.

2011-06-12  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Relase 3.82+dbg-0.7

2011-06-09  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Get ready for release.

2011-04-25  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	If a target is phony, then it doesn't have to have commands to be listed in --tasks. Automake targets like "check" or "install" work this way.

2011-04-21  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	More futzing with --tasks

2011-04-17  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of github.com:rocky/remake

2011-04-17  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Add options --targets and --tasks akin to "rake --tasks". May do more on --tasks to filter out file names and suffix patterns leaving only targets with commands in them.

2011-04-17  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Add subopions to "info targets {position, name, all}. Sometimes we just want the target names. This is a poor-man's "rake --tasks".

	One more small doc correction

2011-04-14  rocky  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Remove one more bash reference

	* configh.dos.template: Remove unconditional definition of 	SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED. 	Include <sys/version.h> because ports of GCC 4.3.0 and later no 	longer include it, so macros like __DJGPP_MINOR__ are no longer 	defined automatically.

	corresponding variables to define LIBDIR, INCLUDEDIR and LOCALEDIR
	instead of using the hardcoded ones.

2009-09-23  psmith  <psmith>

	Added Italian (it) language support.

2009-09-16  psmith  <psmith>

	- Add xcalloc() and call it - Fix memory errors found by valgrind - Remove multi_glob() and empower parse_file_seq() to do its job:   the goal here is to remove the confusing reverse/re-reverse we do on   the file lists: needed for future fixes. - Add a prefix arg to parse_file_seq() - Make concat() variadic so it can take arbitrary #'s of strings

2007-05-08  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix Savannah bug #19656: rationalize our use of case-insensitive string comparison functions to always use POSIX strcasecmp().  For non-POSIX systems that use other functions (strcmpi or stricmp) use a macro to alias strcasecmp to those.  If we can't find any of them (VMS, plus whatever UNIX doesn't have them) then define our own version in misc.c.

2007-03-21  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix Savannah bug #19348: if the user specified --disable-case-insensitive-file-system, don't turn it on.

2007-03-19  psmith  <psmith>

	This is a major update, which switches virtually every allocated-but-not-freed string into the strcache.  As a side-effect, many more structure members and function arguments can/should be declared const.

	As mentioned in the changelog, unfortunately measurement shows that this
	change does not yet reduce memory.  The problem is with secondary expansion:
	because of this we store all the prerequisites in the string cache twice.
	First we store the prerequisite string after initial expansion but before
	secondary expansion, then we store each individual file after secondary
	expansion and expand_deps().  I plan to change expand_deps() to be callable
	in either context (eval or snap_deps) then have non-second-expansion
	targets call expand_deps() during eval, so that we only need to store that
	dependency list once.

2007-03-15  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Add css.

2007-03-10  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

2007-02-28  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	configure.ac: now in 0.63cvs - we can't really fake it any more.

	src/dbg_cmd.c: Add a "list" command. Basically same as "target x depends commands" for now.
	"list -" shows the parent target.

	Help commands now show short usage.

	src/trace.h: Allow us to fathom debugger command errors that stay in the
	read command loop

	Go over documentation to add new features and fix up some old mistakes.

2006-11-20  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Another constification from GNU Make change of Nov 18, '06.

2006-11-20  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	First part of const-ification done to track recent GNU Make changes of Nov 18, '06

2006-11-18  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix from Eli for incorrect value of $(MAKE) on Cygwin.

	A few changes from char* to void* where appropriate, and removing of
	unnecessary casts.

	Much more work on const-ifying the codebase.  This round involves some code
	changes to make it correct.  NOTE!!  There will almost certainly be problems
	on the non-POSIX ports that will need to be addressed after the const changes
	are finished: they will need to be const-ified properly and there may need to
	be some changes to allocate memory, etc. as well.

	The next (last?) big push for this, still to come, is const-ifying the
	filenames in struct file, struct dep, etc.  This will allow us to store file
	names in the string cache and finally resolve Savannah bug #15182 (make uses
	too much memory), among other advantages.

2006-10-01  psmith  <psmith>

	Fixed a number of documentation bugs, plus some build/install issues:   16304, 16468, 16577, 17701, 17880, 16051, 16652, 16698 Plus some from the mailing list.

	Imported a patch from Eli to allow Cygwin builds to support DOS-style
	pathnames.

2006-07-29  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Patch from Dave Korn:

	Final link fails when srcdir != objdir because it looks in the source
	tree for libglob.a rather than the build tree. The following patch
	(followed by regenerating the auto-* files) fixed it for me. HTH!

2006-05-22  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	change url of CVS browser

2006-04-09  psmith  <psmith>

2005-12-21  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	The great makedb->mdb rename. The rename is because we don't want confusion with this and the program that creates a DBM file.

2005-12-21  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Was erroneously showing command delimiters on the "echo" command.

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Doc change.

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	More debug tracing funnelled through db_level. Debugger command "show debug" shows the debug mask in a more understandable way.

2005-12-20  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	job.c: separator bars should be before/after commands even when entering the debugger or stepping. main.c: enter debugger on next/step on successful termination.

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Now shows shell tracing when --trace=normal or stepping debugging. YEAH!

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	debug.h: add mask doc from make.tex make.texi: merge in some of the relevant changes from 3.81 AUTHORS, NEWS: revise for this project

	What the story is for Amiga.

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Remove the more specific free() for now. Crashes on 64-bit athlon systems.

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Remove this horrible hack where stringlist_t's were cast to char ** and issues of memory allocation blithly ignored.

	Fixes a problem with dash-I on cygwin? Definitely reduces valgrind memory
	leaks.

	dash-l: reinstated - I feel lucky?

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	*** empty log message ***

2005-12-19  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Redo tracing a little bit. Output is slightly different. Remove variable tracing - Is now folded into db_level. Change a couple of "int"s to "bool"s

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Output has changed. Reflect that in tests.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Describe --just-print and --debug=basic to show how we differ from that.

	Note set variable SHELL $(SHELL -x) trick to get tracing from the shell.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	tracing is a little more like --just-print

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Give line numbers and target names on --just-print.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Work on doc to bring it in line (a little) with recent work. No longer show target after file location. We have that expanded below with the dependencies.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	makedb.texi: correct automatic variable documentation

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Some nexting tweaks and a free here and there.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Need this because mkinstalldirs isn't in config under this directory.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Update to gettext-0.14.4 and add .PHONY for some phony tags.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Turn some #defines and a char field into an enum.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Go over memory allocation more. Reduce shared pointers. Free memory at the end explicitly so can use valgrind more agressively in the future.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Move code to show target and prerequisites to on debugger prompt out of command routine and into fns. Is now show on stack motion commands.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Wrong &.

2005-12-18  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	We don't have getopt.c any more.

2005-12-17  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Debugger error output changed. Get test results to match up.  Note: print.c needs to be changed to be able to deal with stderr as well as or in addition to stdout.

2005-12-17  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Show target and dependencies in entering debugger. Could/should generalize as part of a prompt string.

2005-12-17  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Changes because extended output on errors is now the default.

2005-12-17  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	More explicit frees of memory. free_hash_table gives a callback for a routine to free an item.

	--extended-errors is now the default. Use --no-extended-errors if you
	don't want that.

	Use installed getopt.{c,h} - that's probably better maintained.

2005-12-16  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Yet another attempt to reduce unexplicitly free'd memory.  The next big win will probably be when we add a item_free function parameter on freeing hash tables.

2005-12-11  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Fix vpath regression test failure on some OS's.  type casting a nameseq_t to a dep_t when is bad, bad, bad. Valgrind was showing uninitialized accesses. We now use calloc more pervasively and we no longer cast nameseq's to dep's but do a proper conversion (and allocationn).

	Show file info line only when line changes - Makes output less verbose and seems to help ddd (which means it's more like other debuggers).

2005-11-20  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

2005-11-17  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Automake magic wasn't working for dvi. I'd rather switch to less automake than fight it.

2005-11-17  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Add tracing attribute for reading Makefiles - was previously only attached to diarrhea --verbose option. --debugger=preread now stops before reading each Makefile.

	emacs/makedeb.el.in, src/dbg_cmd.c: debug lines might not have a target in
	them - e.g.  if we are reading a makefile.

	main.c src/Makefile.am src/debug.c: Split off some debug variables and
	settings. Some things are now a little more gobal than before, but
	main.c really needs made smaller.

2005-11-17  bosk  <bosk>

	Implemented the flavor function which returns the flavor of a variable ('simple', 'recursive', or 'undefined').

2005-11-16  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Use types a little better.

2005-11-16  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Note debugger origin for variables that get changed inside the debugger - say via eval.

2005-11-16  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	print.c: got := and = backwards. types.h, configure.ac, make.h: define boolean type dbg_cmd.c, variable.{c,h}: Now have an origin for debugger changed   (Need to note if set via eval)

2005-11-15  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Now in 0.04cvs. Add EVAL! Add one more typedef: variable_set_list_t Document how to make a release.

2005-11-14  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Add more about target information.

2005-11-14  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

2005-11-13  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	trace: output is more verbose -- correct to match automatic: may be a bug, but might not be. Force match for now.

2005-11-13  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	When debugger enabled, enter debugger when target needs to be remade. Fix core dump in printing location for undefined files.

2005-11-13  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Any tracing or "enter" debugging now sets GNU Makefile "basic" debug listing.

	Abbreviations of debugger command attributes now allowed.

	'list' renamed to 'target'. (Another list command will be added that's
	more like debugger list functions.)

	enumeration: debug_read -> debug_readloop

2005-11-12  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

2005-11-12  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	I guess these are part of CVS.

2005-10-26  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix a crash I introduced last-minute. Try to avoid extraneous rebuilds of template files.

2005-10-24  psmith  <psmith>

	Make second expansion optional (partial implementation).

	I decided this feature was too impacting to make the permanent default
	behavior.  This set of changes makes the default behavior of make the
	old behavior (no second expansion).  If you want second expansion, you
	must define the .SECONDEXPANSION: special target before the first target
	that needs it.

	This set of changes ONLY fixes explicit and static pattern rules to work
	like this.  Implicit rules still have second expansion enabled all the
	time: I'll work on that next.

	Note that there is still a backward-incompatibility: now to get the old
	SysV behavior using $$@ etc. in the prerequisites list you need to set
	.SECONDEXPANSION: as well.

2005-09-28  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Looks like I need readline.h as well.

2005-09-26  psmith  <psmith>

	Make sure to assign a boolean value to a 1-bit bitfield.  Reported on the bug-make mailing list.

	Fix Savannah bug # 14527: remember to free temporary line constructor
	memory if the line is empty.

2005-05-08  psmith  <psmith>

	Document the secondary expansion method.  Also, some other documentation cleanups.

	If we find a make error (invalid makefile syntax or something like that)
	write back any tokens we have before we exit.

	If we have waiting jobs (using -j + -l) set an alarm before we sleep on
	the read() system call, so we can wake up to check the load and start
	waiting jobs, if there are long-running jobs we would otherwise be
	waiting for.  Suggested by Grant Taylor.

2005-05-03  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix problems with losing tokens in the jobserver, reported by Grant Taylor.  There are two forms of this: first, it was possible to lose tokens when using -j and -l at the same time, because waiting jobs were not checked when determining whether any jobs were outstanding.  Second, if you had an exported recursive variable that contained a $(shell ...) function there is a possibility to lose tokens, since a token was taken but the child list was not updated until after the shell function was complete.

	To resolve this I introduced a new variable that counted the number of
	tokens we have obtained, rather than checking whether there were any
	children on the list.  I also added some sanity checks to make sure we
	weren't writing back too many or not enough tokens.  And, the master
	make will drain the token pipe before exiting and compare the count of
	tokens at the end to what was written there at the beginning.

	Also:
	  * Ensure a bug in the environment (missing "=") doesn't cause make to core.
	  * Rename the .DEFAULT_TARGET variable to .DEFAULT_GOAL, to match the
	    terminology in the documentation and other variables like MAKECMDGOALS.
	  * Add documentation of the .DEFAULT_GOAL special variable.

	Still need to document the secondary expansion stuff...

2005-04-25  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	From Rich Paul:

	Sometimes routines allocate objects of type dep_t using xmalloc,
	and not initializing all of the members:  the specific issue noticed
	was that the ignore_mtime field, which marks a target as an 'order
	only' target is not always initialized.  You can recognize that this is
	happening by doing a make -p, and look for target lines like:

	>> tgt:  dep1 | dep2

	The dependency dep1 and it's ilk are normal deps, but changes to dep2 and
	friends will not (if I understand order only targets properly) cause
	tgt to be rebuilt ... their only contribution is that if, for some
	reason, dep2 and tgt are rebuilt, the dep2 target will be completed
	before tgt is started.

	The problem is NOT limited to dep_t structures: if rather than
	initializing all malloc'd memory to 0, I initialize it to 0xff, the
	resulting make cannot even parse it's own src/Makefile: it fails with
	a 'missing separator' message ... this appears to be a separate bug in
	read.c, which has, as of yet, eluded me.

2005-04-16  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Revise readline allegedly to accomodate more readline variations. Patches from Rich Paul.

2005-04-12  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix performance degradation introduced by the second expansion feature. I did this by adding intelligence into the algorithm such that the second expansion was only actually performed when the prerequisite list contained at least one "$", so we knew it is actually needed.

	Without this we were using up a LOT more memory, since every single
	target (even ones never used by make) had their file variables
	initialized.  This also used a lot more CPU, since we needed to create
	and populate a new variable hash table for every target.

	There is one issue remaining with this feature: it leaks memory.  In
	pattern_search() we now initialize the file variables for every pattern
	target, which allocates a hash table, etc.  However, sometimes we
	recursively invoke pattern_search() (for intermediate files) with an
	automatic variable (alloca() I believe) as the file.  When that function
	returns, obviously, the file variable hash memory is lost.

	Add a regression test for "@" before a define/enddef vs. one inside.

2004-11-28  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix for bug #1276: Handle SHELL according to POSIX requirements.

	POSIX requires that the value of SHELL in the makefile NOT be exported
	to sub-commands.  Instead, the value in the environment when make was
	invoked should be passed to the environment of sub-commands.  Note that
	make still uses SHELL to _run_ sub-commands; it just doesn't change the
	value of the SHELL variable in the environment of sub-commands.

	As an extension to POSIX, if the makefile explicitly exports SHELL then
	GNU make _will_ use it in the environment of sub-commands.

2004-11-28  psmith  <psmith>

2004-09-21  psmith  <psmith>

	Some code cleanups and efficiency enhancements.  As far as I can tell none of these have impacts that are visible to the user (although in some cases that appears to be nothing more than dumb luck :-/).

2004-09-21  psmith  <psmith>

	Remove sindex() and replace with strstr(). Windows: allow users to set SHELL to cmd.exe and have it behave as if no UNIX shell were found.

2004-09-21  psmith  <psmith>

	Add some more unit tests for variable flavors. Allow run_make_tests() to be invoked with an undef makefile string, in which case it re-uses the previous string.

2004-09-21  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix some bugs in variable pattern substitution (e.g. $(VAR:A=B)), reported by Markus Mauhart <qwe123@chello.at>.  One was a simple typo; to fix the other we call patsubst_expand() for all instances of variable substitution, even when there is no '%'.  We used to call subst_expand() with a special flag set in the latter case, but it didn't work properly in all situations.  Easier to just use patsubst_expand() since that's what it is.

	Improve target-stack tracking. Still could be better and cleaner.

2004-06-24  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	Add ability to print specified attributes of a target, e.g. "time", "deps", "vars"

	Same thing we did in print.c: If target doesn't have a location but
	it has commands that do, use those to derive the target location.

2004-06-24  R. Bernstein  <rocky@gnu.org>

	When printing location, If the target is an absolute filename, don't prepend starting-directory.  starting-directory is only needed if a relative filename.

	When printing target. If we don't have location info for the target
	but do have location info for the commands it runs, use that to derive
	a target location. (Right now we assume the target is the line before
	the line that the commands start.)

	Error messages which give a location now appear more often.

	On error we can give a stack trace if option --extended-errors (-E)
	was set.

	We also have POSIX shell "set -x" like call tracking with the option
	--trace (-x).

	don't properly implement SA_RESTART: important system calls like stat() can
	still fail when SA_RESTART is set.  So, forget the BROKEN_RESTART config
	check and get rid of atomic_stat() and atomic_readdir(), and implement
	permanent wrappers for EINTR checking on various system calls (stat(),

	problem with the loadavg test program, but the rest of the code works.  I'm
	asking the automake list about this problem.

2002-10-13  psmith  <psmith>

	Fix bug#1379: don't use alloca() where it could overrun the stack size.

	Update to a new version of automake and gettext. Invent a new macro HAVE_DOS_PATHS and change various instances of:   #if defined(WINDOWS) || defined(__MSDOS__) to use the new macro instead.  This should help make the OS/2 port cleaner, as well. Invent a cvs-clean maintainer target that tries to get the workspace back to the state it was in after a CVS checkout. New language.

1996-05-22  roland  <roland>

	Wed May 15 10:14:14 CDT 1996  Rob Tulloh  <tulloh@tivoli.com>

	* dir.c: WIN32 does not support inode. For now, fully qualified
	pathname along with st_mtime will be keys for files.
	Fixed problem where vpath can be confused when files
	are added to a directory after the directory has already been
	read in. The code now attempts to reread the directory if it
	discovers that the datestamp on the directory has changed since
	it was cached by make. This problem only seems to occur on WIN32
	right now so it is lumped under port #ifdef WIN32.

	* function.c: WIN32: call subproc library (CreateProcess()) instead of
	fork/exec.

	* job.c: WIN32: Added the code to do fork/exec/waitpid style processing
	on WIN32 systems via calls to subproc library.

	* main.c: WIN32: Several things added here. First, there is code
	for dealing with PATH and SHELL defaults. Make tries to figure
	out if the user has %PATH% set in the environment and sets it to
	%Path% if it is not set already. Make also looks to see if sh.exe
	is anywhere to be found. Code path through job.c will change
	based on existence of a working Bourne shell. The checking for
	default shell is done twice: once before makefiles are read in
	and again after. Fall back to MSDOS style execution mode if no sh.exe
	is found. Also added some debug support that allows user to pause make
	with -D switch and attach a debugger. This is especially useful for
	debugging recursive calls to make where problems appear only in the
	sub-make.

	* make.h: WIN32: A few macros and header files for WIN32 support.

	* misc.c: WIN32: Added a function end_of_token_w32() to assist
	in parsing code in read.c.

	* read.c: WIN32: Fixes similar to MSDOS which allow colon to
	appear in filenames. Use of colon in filenames would otherwise
	confuse make.

	* remake.c: WIN32: Added include of io.h to eliminate compiler
	warnings. Added some code to default LIBDIR if it is not set
	on WIN32.

	* variable.c: WIN32: Added support for detecting Path/PATH
	and converting them to semicolon separated lists for make's
	internal use. New function sync_Path_environment()
	which is called in job.c and function.c before creating a new
	process. Caller must set Path in environment since we don't
	have fork() to do this for us.

	* vpath.c: WIN32: Added detection for filenames containing
	forward or backward slashes.

	* NMakefile: WIN32: Visual C compatible makefile for use with nmake.
	Use this to build GNU make the first time on Windows NT or Windows 95.

	* README.WIN32: WIN32: Contains some helpful notes.

	* build_w32.bat: WIN32: If you don't like nmake, use this the first
	time you build GNU make on Windows NT or Windows 95.

	* config.h.WIN32: WIN32 version of config.h

	* subproc.bat: WIN32: A bat file used to build the
	subproc library from the top-level NMakefile. Needed because
	WIndows 95 (nmake) doesn't allow you to cd in a make rule.

	* w32/include/dirent.h
	* w32/compat/dirent.c: WIN32: opendir, readdir, closedir, etc.

	* w32/include/pathstuff.h: WIN32: used by files needed functions
	defined in pathstuff.c (prototypes).

	* w32/include/sub_proc.h: WIN32: prototypes for subproc.lib functions.

	* w32/include/w32err.h: WIN32: prototypes for w32err.c.

	* w32/pathstuff.c: WIN32: File and Path/Path conversion functions.

	* w32/subproc/build.bat: WIN32: build script for subproc library
	if you don't wish to use nmake.

	* w32/subproc/NMakefile: WIN32: Visual C compatible makefile for use
	with nmake. Used to build subproc library.

	* w32/subproc/misc.c: WIN32: subproc library support code
	* w32/subproc/proc.h: WIN32: subproc library support code

	job.c, main.c, make.h, read.c, remake.c
	* commands.c: Amiga has neither SIGHUP nor SIGQUIT
	* dir.c: Amiga has filenames with Upper- and Lowercase,
	but "FileName" is the same as "filename". Added strieq()
	which is use to compare filenames. This is like streq()
	on all other systems. Also there is no such thing as
	"." under AmigaDOS.
	* function.c: On Amiga, the environment is not passed as envp,
	there are no pipes and Amiga can't fork. Use my own function
	to create a new child.
	* job.c: default_shell is "" (The system automatically chooses
	a shell for me). Have to use the same workaround as MSDOS for
	running batch commands. Added HAVE_SYS_PARAM_H. NOFILE isn't
	known on Amiga. Cloned code to run children from MSDOS. Own
	version of sh_chars[] and sh_cmds[]. No dup2() or dup() on Amiga.
	* main.c: Force stack to 20000 bytes. Read environment from ENV:
	device. On Amiga, exec_command() does return, so I exit()
	afterwards.
	* make.h: Added strieq() to compare filenames.
	* read.c: Amiga needs special extension to have passwd. Only
	one include-dir. "Makefile" and "makefile" are the same.
	Added "SMakefile".  Added special code to handle device names (xxx:)
	and "./" in rules.
	* remake.c: Only one lib-dir. Amiga link-libs are named "%s.lib"
	instead of "lib%s.a".
